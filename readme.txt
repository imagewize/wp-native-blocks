Scaffold native Gutenberg blocks for block themes via WP-CLI with per-block builds using @wordpress/scripts.

== Description ==

WP Native Blocks is a powerful WP-CLI tool that helps WordPress theme developers quickly scaffold native Gutenberg blocks with best practices for block themes (FSE).

**Features:**

* Per-block build system with @wordpress/scripts
* React-based blocks with JSX components
* Standard block structure (src/ â†’ build/)
* Block templates (base, generic, Moiraine theme)
* Automatic block registration in functions.php
* Simple WP-CLI commands

**Designed for Block Themes:**

This plugin is specifically built for modern WordPress block themes (Full Site Editing). Each block gets its own package.json and builds independently using @wordpress/scripts.

**Usage:**

```
wp block create vendor/block-name
wp block create imagewize/hero --template=moiraine-hero
```

Requires WP-CLI to be installed on your development environment.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Ensure WP-CLI is installed on your system
3. Run `wp block create` to scaffold your first block
4. Follow the prompts or use command options

**Via WP-CLI:**

```
wp plugin install wp-native-blocks --activate
```

**Via Composer:**

```
composer require imagewize/wp-native-blocks --dev
```

npm run start  # Development
npm run build  # Production
